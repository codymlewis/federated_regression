# The Exacerbation of Permutation Invariance and Overfitting in Federated Learning of Regression Tasks

The Jupyter notebook in this repo discusses and demonstrates an issue when performing federated learning
of regression tasks with clients that have i.i.d. data.


## Run the Demo

After installing Python 3.8+, install the required libraries:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you may need to install jupyter-lab, once that is done run `jupyter lab` and open `Federated Regression.ipynb`, you can run
through the code with the play button at the top or beside code cells.
